            Robert founded Upholdings in 2019 to develop benchmark beating investment strategies for forward-looking investors.
            <br/><br/>
            He began his career working under Roger McNamee, helping to scout through new opportunities created by the early rise of the internet. In 2013, he joined Everlane to help scale an online-first brand into a household name.
            <br/><br/>
            He observed that in all successful online businesses, a higher standard of transparency, quality, and price is an absolute must. Upholdings was borne out of the frustration that legacy investment funds have yet to adjust to this new reality.
            <br/><br/>
            Upholdings is currently only open to accredited investors, but will eventually be accessible via a tax- and fee-efficient ETF.
