  our future.

  by technology, regulatory, and social changes—that enable the best positioned companies
  to deliver above average earnings growth. That’s our focus.
differenceA_h3: Internet-Connected Assets
differenceA_p: The proliferation of always-on mobile devices has connected our houses,
  cars, and cash to the internet, resulting in new services like homesharing and mobile
  payments. Growing demand for these services is driving earnings for the companies
  and assets powering these new networks.
differenceB_h3: A More Personal Web
differenceB_p: 'After spending the last decade uploading our memories and preferences
  onto the web, we have entered a new era of personalization. Business models built
  around the individual are thriving: self-expression, targeted advertising, and collaboration
  tools.'
differenceC_h3: The All Digital Enterprise
differenceC_p: Processing power, storage, and applications have all moved into the
  cloud. Great investment opportunities are emerging in both the businesses providing
  these services as well as those poised to benefit the most from their use.

  to come. As long term investors, we aim to grow with our investments.

  and also ensure companies can generate double digit returns on newly invested capital.

  Robert founded Upholdings in 2019 to generate benchmark beating returns for the next generation of investors.

  He began his career working under Roger McNamee, helping to scout through new opportunities created by the early rise of the internet. In 2013, he joined Everlane to help scale an online-first retailer into an internationally recognized brand.

  He observed that in all successful online businesses, a higher standard of transparency, quality, and price is a requirement. Upholdings was borne out of the opportunity to do exactly that with investing.

  Upholdings is currently only open to accredited investors, but will eventually be accessible via a tax- and fee-efficient ETF.
