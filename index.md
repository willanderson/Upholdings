bio: |-
  Robert founded Upholdings in 2019 to generate benchmark beating returns for the next generation of investors.

  He began his career working under Roger McNamee, helping to scout through new opportunities created by the early rise of the internet. He then joined Everlane to help grow an online-first retailer into an internationally recognized brand.

  The best online businesses deliver a higher standard of transparency, quality, and price. Upholdings was borne out of the opportunity to do exactly that with investing.

  Upholdings is currently only open to accredited investors.
