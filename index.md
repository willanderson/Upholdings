hero_h1: Modern Investing
hero_p: Compound your capital faster by investing into the best companies building
  our future.
manifesto: We invest towards the future. Every generation, there are new market forces—driven
  by technology, regulatory, and social changes—that enable the best positioned companies
  to deliver better than average earnings growth. That’s our focus.
differenceA_h3: Internet-Connected Asset
differenceA_p: The proliferation of always-on mobile devices has connected our houses,
  cars, and cash to the internet, resulting in new services like homesharing and mobile
  payments. Growing demand for these services is driving earnings for the companies
  and assets powering these new networks.
differenceB_h3: A More Personal Web
differenceB_p: 'After spending the last decade uploading our memories and preferences
  onto the web, we have entered a new era of personalization. Business models built
  around the individual are thriving: self-expression, targeted advertising, and collaboration
  tools.'
differenceC_h3: The All Digital Enterprise
differenceC_p: Processing power, storage, and applications have all moved into the
  cloud. Great investment opportunities are emerging in both the businesses providing
  these services as well as those poised to benefit the most from their use.
approachA_h3: Globally Sourced
approachA_p: The best brands and technology breakout beyond their own borders to become
  global leaders. So we scour the world for 25-30 leading multi-billion-market-cap
  companies.
approachB_h3: Forward-Looking
approachB_p: Over time, we invest more and more into the same businesses. Thus, we
  select for business models that can continue building market share for years to
  come.
approachC_h3: Rooted in Value
approachC_p: We ensure that our entry multiples afford a high probability for future
  share appreciation, and seek out companies that can generate a double digit return
  on newly invested capital.
bio: |
  Robert founded Upholdings in 2019 to develop benchmark beating investment strategies for forward-looking investors.

  He began his career working under Roger McNamee, helping to scout through new opportunities created by the early rise of the internet. In 2013, he joined Everlane to help scale an online-first brand into a household name.

  He observed that in all successful online businesses, a higher standard of transparency, quality, and price is an absolute must. Upholdings was borne out of the frustration that legacy investment funds have yet to adjust to this new reality.

  Upholdings is currently only open to accredited investors, but will eventually be accessible via a tax- and fee-efficient ETF.
