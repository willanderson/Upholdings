  by technology, regulatory, and social changes—that enable the best positioned companies

  and assets powering these new networks.

  tools.'

differenceC_p: Processing power, storage, and applications have all moved into the
  cloud. Great investment opportunities are emerging in both the businesses providing

  and target double digit returns on newly invested capital.
bio: |
  Robert founded Upholdings in 2019 to generate benchmark beating returns for the next generation of investors.

  He began his career working under Roger McNamee, helping to scout through new opportunities created by the early rise of the internet. He then joined Everlane to help scale an online-first retailer into an internationally recognized brand.

  He observed that to be successful online, businesses must deliver a higher standard of transparency, quality, and price. Upholdings was borne out of the opportunity to do exactly that with investing.

  Upholdings is currently only open to accredited investors, but will eventually be accessible via a tax- and fee-efficient ETF.
