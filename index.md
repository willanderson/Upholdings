  future.

  by technology, regulatory, and social changes—that rupture legacy business models
  and allow modern ones to grow in their place. That’s our focus.
differenceA_h3: Internet-Connected Assets
differenceA_p: The proliferation of always-on mobile devices has connected our houses,
  cars, and cash to the web, resulting in new services like homesharing and digital
  payments. Ever-improving connections - fueled by 5G - will further strengthen the
  assets underlying these services.
differenceB_h3: A More Personal Web
differenceB_p: 'The rules of operating an online business are being rewritten. Privacy,
  protection, and personal preferences are now priorities for businesses both big
  and small. Business models built around the individual will thrive: curated experiences,
  collaboration, and self-expression.'
differenceC_h3: The All Digital Enterprise
differenceC_p: Processing power, storage, and applications have all moved into the
  cloud. Great investment opportunities are emerging in both the businesses providing
  these services as well as those poised to benefit the most from their use.

  the best business models that can grow faster than the market over time.

  and target double digit returns on newly invested capital.
bio: |
  Robert founded Upholdings in 2019 to generate benchmark beating returns for the next generation of investors.

  He began his career working under Roger McNamee, helping to scout through new opportunities created by the early rise of the internet. He then joined Everlane to help scale an online-first retailer into an internationally recognized brand.

  To be successful online, businesses must deliver a higher standard of transparency, quality, and price. Upholdings was borne out of the opportunity to do exactly that with investing.

  Upholdings is currently only open to accredited investors, but will eventually be accessible via a tax- and fee-efficient ETF.
