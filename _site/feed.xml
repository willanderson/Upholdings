Below we share approaches that we use at Upholdings to deliver market beating returns, that you can also use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, here are the eight most important questions we have for any potential investment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the company compete in a large and attractive market?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can the company attract and retain talented staff?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the company sell globally attractive products and have a pipeline for more?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are environmental and societal impacts considered in the company’s expansion?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is every customer transaction a profitable one for the company?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What low cost marketing channels are available to access customers?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does the team transform profits into shareholder value?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are shares available at a price that is a clear discount to the company’s potential?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative Data You Can Access From Home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LinkedIn tells you how quickly a company is growing its employee base and how senior of employees it is hiring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Former employees: send a message to someone’s that has been out of the company for 1+ years; most people enjoy talking about their careers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apptopia: for free, they’ll tell you how many ratings by # of stars an app is getting each month on Android or Apple — the growth in review counts provide a great measure of the apps popularity and growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Sheet: build a basic financial projection — what numbers do you think the company will do? Insiders and analysts fail to accurately forecast their own business all the time, so go ahead and take a shot!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alerts: setup an alert to receive a daily digest on all the news that’s coming out on the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easier than ever to get to the right answers. The hard part is being patient and only buying additional shares when the market offers a price that just can’t be beat.&lt;/p&gt;
