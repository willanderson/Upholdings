Below are examples from Upholdings that we employ to deliver market beating returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-eight-questions&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our eight questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the company compete in a large market with a defensible position?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are the staff talented and motivated to keep growing with the company?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do the products lead their category in domestic and international markets?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is leadership actively considering societal impacts from the company’s expansion?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the company transact profitably with all of its customers?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What low cost marketing channels are available to access new customers?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the team transform profits into shareholder value?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are shares available at a clear discount to the company’s potential?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company-released financial statements, annual reports, and transcripts are an excellent place to start answering those questions. But to figure out if it’s not just a good investment, but really a great investment, we have to go a step further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alternative-data-you-can-access-from-home&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Data You Can Access From Home:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LinkedIn Premium has a tool that tells you how quickly a company is growing its employee base what types of employees they are hiring: is the company hiring salespeople and growing revenue, or is the company in investment-mode and hiring more engineers to build things?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Former employees: send a message to someone’s that has been out of the company for 1+ years; most people enjoy talking about their careers&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;appfigures: for free, they’ll tell you how many ratings by # of stars an app is getting each month on Android or Apple — the growth in review counts provide a great measure of the apps popularity and growth&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google Sheet: build a basic financial projection — what numbers do you think the company will do? Insiders and analysts fail to accurately forecast their own business all the time, so go ahead and take a shot!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google Alerts: setup an alert to receive a daily digest on all the news that’s coming out on the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are additional tools out there - email receipt tracking, private company revenue estimates - but you have to pay money for those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the web has made it easier than ever to find the right answers, the hard part is exercising patience and only buying additional shares when the market offers a price that just can’t be beat.&lt;/p&gt;
