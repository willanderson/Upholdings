I"<p>Every investor needs just two things to evaluate a potential investment: the right questions and the tools to answer those questions. Below are examples from Upholdings that we use to deliver market-beating returns.</p>

<h2 id="our-eight-questions"><strong>Our Eight Questions:</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does the company compete in a <strong>large market</strong> with a defensible position?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the staff <strong>talented and motivated</strong> to keep growing with the company?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the products <strong>lead their category</strong> in global markets?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is leadership actively considering <strong>societal impacts</strong> from their expansion?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <strong>low-cost marketing channels</strong> are available to access customers?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the company <strong>transact profitably</strong> with all customers?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the team transform profits into <strong>shareholder value</strong>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are shares available at a <strong>clear discount</strong> to the company’s potential?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Company-released financial statements and reports are an excellent place to start. But to figure out if it’s a once-in-a-lifetime investment, we have to go a step further.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-data-sources"><strong>Alternative Data Sources:</strong></h2>

<p>With modern tools, we can use a whole lot more than company-released statistics to evaluate investments. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LinkedIn Premium:</strong> see the number of employees by function at a company. Are they hiring salespeople to grow revenue, or hiring engineers to invest in new products?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>appfigures:</strong> track the number of ratings that apps are receiving each month in the Apple and Android stores. How popular is the app and are its ratings improving over time?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Seeking Alpha:</strong> read management transcripts from conferences and quarterly calls to see how insiders are running the company. Are they prioritizing the right growth initiatives?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Former Employees:</strong> connect with someone on LinkedIn that works in the same industry as your target investment. What do they think about the business?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Alerts:</strong> receive a daily digest on all the news around a specific company. Are customers raving or complaining about it? How do world events affect the business?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The web has made it easier than ever to find answers. After you find a great company, the next challenge is to be patient enough to wait for the market to offer a price that just can’t be beat.</p>
