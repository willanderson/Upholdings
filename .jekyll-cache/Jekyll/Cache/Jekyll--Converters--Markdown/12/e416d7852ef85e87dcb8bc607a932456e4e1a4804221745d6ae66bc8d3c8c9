I"—<p>Global travel and tourism generates $8.8 trillion in activity every year. Airbnb, founded in 2008, is on track to complete <strong>over $30 billion in bookings</strong> in 2020 alone.</p>

<p>Their model has unlocked a new type of vacation: the local one. With consumers trading in goods for experiences, Airbnb is at the center of enabling the experience economy.</p>

<p>Uber was introduced to public investors with a business that took billions to build and still needed billions more. The valuation flopped: the public market cannot sustainably value unsustainable business practices.</p>

<p>Airbnb, by contrast, still holds <strong>an estimated $3 billion of the $3.4 billion</strong> it raised from investors. They have a great business model: the majority of properties are paid for 10 days in advance with hosts getting paid <em>after</em> guests arrive. This generates billions of â€˜floatâ€™ to the company.</p>

<p>The best investments in our current economy are empowering individuals to lead more prosperous lives. The gig economy creates more opportunities for hourly income, online marketplaces enable small businesses to sell to anyone around the world, and property sharing turns any property owner into a host.</p>

<p>With an estimated <strong>30%+ market share of worldwide property sharing</strong>, we expect Airbnb to continue leading the industry forward. We acquired shares for our fund through Forge Global.</p>
