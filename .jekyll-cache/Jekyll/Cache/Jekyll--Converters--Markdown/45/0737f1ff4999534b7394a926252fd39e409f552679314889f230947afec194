<p>Pinterest was introduced to the public less than a year ago. Like most IPOs, the stock has been volatile while the public figures out whether the company is a keeper.</p>

<p><strong>If Google killed the library, Pinterest is killing the magazine.</strong> It’s a place for planning - weddings, dinner parties, outfits, kitchen remodels, office parks, you name it.</p>

<p>The company has turned a high value destination for people into a high performing place for advertisers. Many digital advertisers are calling out Pinterest as the most important new platform to watch.</p>

<h2 id="how-fast-is-it-growing">How Fast Is It Growing?</h2>

<p>We use two metrics to understand growth: Monthly Active Users and Gross Profit per Person. For example, Apple has an installed base of 1.5B that grew 8% in 2019, and generated $67.72 of gross profit per person, down -4%:</p>

<p>Pinterest is rapidly growing both the number of people on its platform and the profit per person. The company still has a long way to go to match the giants. <strong>For a complete database of profit per person metrics across 50+ companies, email us at invest@upholdings.com.</strong></p>

<p>Revenue is a bad metric for evaluating the success of new businesses. So instead, we use Margin = Gross Profit - Marketing to filter out revenue that’s brought in from excessive discounting or marketing spend. Here’s how a few recent IPOs stack up:</p>

<p>Pinterest is again in a rare position. The company is generating a lot of margin, while still available at a valuation supported by its 40%+ growth rate. <strong>For a complete database of Market Cap / Margin metrics across 50+ companies, email us at invest@upholdings.com.</strong></p>

<p>At Upholdings, we began buying Pinterest shares below $20, and believe that current market pricing still offers a double-digit return to investors with a long term approach (3+ years).</p>
