I"ý<h2 id="its-reshaping-a-huge-industry">Itâ€™s reshaping a huge industry:</h2>

<p>The global travel and tourism industry generates $8.8 trillion in activity every year. Airbnb, founded in 2008, is on track to complete over $30 billion* in bookings in 2020 alone.</p>

<p>Traditional hospitality providers - like Marriott - had to spend billions building hotels to accommodate travelers. Airbnb, by contrast, invests in modern technology that enables any property owner to become a host.</p>

<h2 id="its-business-model-generates-a-lot-of-cash">Itâ€™s business model generates a lot of cash:</h2>

<p>Uber, WeWork, and Slack were all introduced to public investors with businesses that took billions to build and were still losing cash. Their valuations all flopped - the public market cannot apply a sustainable valuation to unsustainable business practices.</p>

<p>Airbnb, by contrast, still holds more than $3 billion of the $3.4 billion it raised from investors. Part of this is explained by their business model: 80% of properties are paid for at least 10 days in advance, but hosts are not paid until 1-2 days after guests arrive. 1-2 weeks of cashflow to the company across millions of Airbnbs creates billions in cash to manage the business.</p>
