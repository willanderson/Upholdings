I":<p>The early winners and losers of COVID-19 have been picked. But volatility remains high for companies waiting out a return to normal. While we expect a stabilization to occur, we are planning for it to take longer than most current forecasts.</p>

<h2 id="ch-ch-changes">Ch-Ch-Changes</h2>
<p>This year has stricken many of us with stress and uncertainty. Through it all, we’re listening closely to workers, customers, and colleagues to hear how they’re adapting. We’re studying how the many recent changes are having long term impacts on business models.</p>

<p>Physical spaces are undergoing permanent transformations. Use of online platforms is accelerating. Restaurants are paring down menus and expanding outdoors. And every person and business is doubling down on their remote capabilities.</p>

<p>Compounding investment returns during downturns is challenging for anybody. But, downturns help reveal those that are most adept to change. For example, Etsy enabled $346 million in face mask sales; up from $0 million a year ago. We can’t predict what will be sold on their platform in the future, but we’re confident in their seller base to adapt to whatever’s most in demand.</p>

<h2 id="buying-book-value">Buying Book Value</h2>
<p>In the third quarter, we saw unusual prices for assets that have successfully maneuvered previous economic cycles. Berkshire Hathaway traded near book value. The Starbucks brand remained on sale while other market leaders recovered. And some premium real estate - typically occupied by offices or hotels - traded below replacement costs.</p>

<p>We acquired more shares of Berkshire and Starbucks, and also made one large new investment in Cousins Properties. Cousins owns iconic office towers in the fastest growing cities in the US - Austin, Charlotte, Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix. Leasing out office space will be a challenging business in the near term - there is a lot of supply coming in the form of subleases from existing tenants. While this will pressure landlords over the next couple years, we do not believe it will result in permanent impairment to their underlying buildings.</p>

<p>Our largest divestment in the quarter was half of our position in Apple. While we are excited about the company’s growth in new products, their reliance on slowing iPhone sales (50% of revenue) will continue pressuring long term performance. We also exited our position in Ulta Beauty after failing to find evidence of their large format stores profitably repurposing for a post-pandemic economy.</p>

<p>We supported the below two organizations in the quarter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>American Red Cross: The pandemic is driving up the demand for blood, while simultaneously slowing our ability to collect it. Our team donated both blood and money.</li>
  <li>California Fire Foundation: Fires are becoming a new part of life on the west coast. This organization provides support to firefighters making big sacrifices to keep up the fight.</li>
</ul>
