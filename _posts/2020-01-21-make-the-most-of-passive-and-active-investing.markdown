Upholdings Combines the Best of Passive and Active Investing

Three characteristics of a portfolio: performance, taxes, fees.

Performance = buy-and-hold best-in-class companies at bargain prices

Taxes = low turnover portfolio, ideally owned via an exchange-traded fund that has additional tax benefits compared to a mutual fund.

Fees = focus on funds charging <1% in annual fees. Low turnover funds also mean lower fees due to diminished brokerage charges.

Passive: buy-and-hold, low fees, tax efficient compounding.\
Active: concentrated, rebalance away from companies that fail to execute.
