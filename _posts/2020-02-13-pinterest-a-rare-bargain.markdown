Pinterest was introduced to the public less than a year ago. Like most IPOs, the stock has been volatile while the public figures out whether the company is a keeper.

## Pinterest Is A Keeper

**If Google killed the library, Pinterest is killing the magazine.** It’s a place for planning - weddings, dinner parties, outfits, kitchen remodels, office parks, you name it. 

The company has turned a high value destination for people into a high performing place for advertisers. Many digital advertisers are calling out Pinterest as the most important new platform to watch. 

## How Fast Is It Growing?

We use two metrics to understand growth: Monthly Active Users and Gross Profit per Person. For example, Apple has an installed base of 1.5B people using their products every month, and generates $67.72 of gross profit per person per year:

Pinterest is rapidly growing the number of people on its platform, as well as the gross profit per person. The company still has a long way to go to match the giants. **For a complete database of profit per person metrics across 50+ companies, email us at invest@upholdings.com.**

## How To Value Their Growth

Revenue is a bad metric for evaluating the success of new businesses. So instead, we use Margin = Gross Profit - Marketing to filter out revenue that’s brought in from excessive discounting or marketing spend. Here’s how recent IPOs stack up:

Pinterest is again in a rare position. The company is generating a lot of margin, while still available at a valuation supported by its 40%+ growth. **For a complete database of Market Cap / Margin metrics across 50+ companies, email us at invest@upholdings.com.**

At Upholdings, we began buying Pinterest shares below $20, and believe that current market pricing still offers a double-digit return to investors with a long term approach (3+ years).
