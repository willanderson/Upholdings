Pinterest was introduced to the public less than a year ago. Like most IPOs, the stock has been volatile while the public figures out whether the company is a keeper.

# Pinterest Is A Keeper

If Google killed the library, Pinterest is killing the magazine. It’s a place for planning - weddings, dinner parties, outfits, kitchen remodels, office parks, you name it. 

The company has turned a high value destination for people into a high performing place for advertisers. Many digital advertisers are calling out Pinterest as the most important new platform to watch. 

# How Fast Is It Growing?

We compare growth in people using the platform against other major platforms. We use Monthly Active Users to estimate people and Gross Profit to estimate value generated per person. Our findings:

Pinterest is rapidly growing the number of people on its platform, while also having a lot of room left to increase profit per person over time. For our complete database of profit per person metrics across 50+ companies, email us at invest@upholdings.com.

# How To Value Their Growth

Revenue is a bad metric for evaluating the success of new businesses. So instead, we prefer Margin = Gross Profit - Marketing to filter out revenue that’s brought in from excessive discounting or marketing spend. Here’s how recent IPOs stack up:

Pinterest is again in a rare position. The company is generating a lot of margin, while still available at a valuation supported by its 40%+ growth. For our complete database Market Cap / Margin metrics across 50+ companies, email us at invest@upholdings.com.

At Upholdings, we began buying Pinterest shares below $20, and believe that current market pricing still offers a double-digit return to investors with a long term approach (3+ years).
