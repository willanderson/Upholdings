Every investor needs two things to evaluate a potential investment: (1) the right questions, and (2) tools to answer those questions. Below are examples from Upholdings that we employ to deliver market beating returns.

### Our eight questions:

1. Does the company compete in a large market with a defensible position?

2. Are the staff talented and motivated to keep growing with the company?

3. Do the products lead their category in domestic and international markets? 

4. Is leadership actively considering societal impacts from the company’s expansion?

5. Does the company transact profitably with all of its customers?

6. What low cost marketing channels are available to access new customers?

7. How does the team transform profits into shareholder value?

8. Are shares available at a clear discount to the company’s potential?

Company-released financial statements, annual reports, and management transcripts are an excellent place to start answering those questions. But to figure out if it's not just a good investment, but actually a great investment, we have to go a step further.

### Alternative Data You Can Access From Home:

* LinkedIn tells you how quickly a company is growing its employee base and how senior of employees it is hiring

* Former employees: send a message to someone’s that has been out of the company for 1\+ years; most people enjoy talking about their careers

* Apptopia: for free, they’ll tell you how many ratings by # of stars an app is getting each month on Android or Apple — the growth in review counts provide a great measure of the apps popularity and growth

* Google Sheet: build a basic financial projection — what numbers do you think the company will do? Insiders and analysts fail to accurately forecast their own business all the time, so go ahead and take a shot!

* Google Alerts: setup an alert to receive a daily digest on all the news that’s coming out on the company.

There are additional tools if you're ready to really start spending money.

It’s easier than ever to get to the right answers. The hard part is being patient and only buying additional shares when the market offers a price that just can’t be beat.
