Every investor needs two things to evaluate a potential investment: (1) the right questions, and (2) tools to answer those questions. Below are examples from Upholdings that we use to deliver market-beating returns.

## **Our Eight Questions:**

1. Does the company compete in a **large market** with a defensible position?

2. Are the staff **talented and motivated** to keep growing with the company?

3. Do the products **lead their category** in global markets?

4. Is leadership actively considering **societal impacts** from their expansion?

5. What **low-cost marketing channels** are available to access customers?

6. Does the company **transact profitably** with all customers?

7. How does the team transform profits into **shareholder value**?

8. Are shares available at a **clear discount** to the company’s potential?

Company-released financial statements and reports are an excellent place to start. But to figure out if it's a once-in-a-lifetime investment, we have to go a step further.

## **Alternative Data Sources:**

With modern tools, we can use a whole lot more than company-released statistics to evaluate investments. Here are some examples:

1. **LinkedIn Premium:** see the number of employees by function at a company. Are they hiring salespeople to grow revenue, or hiring engineers to invest in new products?

2. **appfigures:** track the number of ratings that apps are receiving each month in the Apple and Android stores. How popular is the app and are its ratings improving over time?

3. **Seeking Alpha:** read management transcripts from conferences and quarterly calls to see how insiders are running the company. Are they prioritizing the right growth initiatives?

4. **Former Employees:** connect with someone on LinkedIn that works in the same industry as your target investment. What do they think about the business?

5. **Google Alerts:** receive a daily digest on all the news around a specific company. Are customers raving or complaining about it? How do world events affect the business?

The web has made it easier than ever to find answers. After you find a great company, the next challenge is to be patient enough to wait for the market to offer a price that just can’t be beat.
