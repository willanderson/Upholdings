## **It’s Reshaping A Huge Industry:**

The global travel and tourism industry generates $8.8 trillion in activity every year. Airbnb, founded in 2008, is on track to complete over $30 billion\* in bookings in 2020 alone.

Traditional hospitality providers, like Marriott, had to spend billions building hotels to accommodate travelers. Airbnb, by contrast, invests in modern technology that enables any property owner to become a host.

## **It's Business Model Generates A Lot Of Cash:**

Uber, WeWork, and Slack were all introduced to public investors with businesses that took billions to build and were still losing cash. Their valuations all flopped - the public market cannot apply a sustainable valuation to unsustainable business practices.

Airbnb, by contrast, still holds more than $3 billion of the $3.4 billion it raised from investors. Part of this is explained by their business model: the majority of properties are paid for at least 10 days in advance, but hosts don't get paid out until after guests arrive. This creates billions in cash 'float' across millions of Airbnb listings.

## **It’s online:**

There are many ways to track the growth of businesses built in the digital world.
