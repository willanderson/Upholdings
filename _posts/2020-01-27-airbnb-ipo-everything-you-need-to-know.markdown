## **It’s Reshaping A Huge Industry:**

The global travel and tourism industry generates $8.8 trillion in activity every year. Airbnb, founded in 2008, is on track to complete over **$30 billion\* in bookings** in 2020 alone.

Their new model has unlocked a new type of travel: vacationing in your own region. You no longer have to get on a plane to fly somewhere aspirational; you can now find opportunities to getaway in your surrounding communities.

## **It's Business Model Generates A Lot Of Cash:**

Uber, WeWork, and Slack were all introduced to public investors with businesses that took billions to build and were still losing cash. Their valuations all flopped: the public market cannot sustainably value unsustainable business practices.

Airbnb, by contrast, **still holds more than $3 billion** of the $3.4 billion it raised from investors. They have a great business model: the majority of properties are paid for at least 10 days in advance, but hosts don't get paid until after guests arrive. This generates billions in 'float' across millions of listings.

## **It’s Creating An Ecosystem Of New Companies:**

The best investments are typically platforms that enable other businesses to prosper. Airbnb's core offering  - a suite of services that enables **any property owner** to become a host - is exactly that.

To further support this community of entrepreneurs, other services like AirDNA have sprouted up. SensorTower estimates that Airbnb’s share of homesharing app downloads rose from 42% in 2015 to 69% in 2019. That means the company's leadership is spending time on the right things.

We’ve been acquiring shares in Airbnb via Forge Global, and plan to be investors for decades.
