## **It’s Reshaping A Huge Industry:**

Global travel and tourism generates $8.8 trillion in activity every year. Airbnb, founded in 2008, is on track to complete over **$30 billion\* in bookings** in 2020 alone.

Their new model has unlocked a new type of vacation: the local one. With consumers trading in goods for experiences, Airbnb is at the center of growing the experience economy.

## **It's Business Model Generates A Lot Of Cash:**

Uber was introduced to public investors with a business that took billions to build and still needed billions more. Their valuation flopped: the public market cannot sustainably value unsustainable business practices.

Airbnb, by contrast, **still holds an estimated $3 billion** of the $3.4 billion it raised from investors. They have a great business model: the majority of properties are paid for at least 10 days in advance, but hosts don't get paid until after guests arrive. This generates billions in "float" to the company.

## **And It’s Delivering Value To All Stakeholders:**

The best investments in our current economy are empowering individuals to **lead more prosperous lives**. The gig economy creates more sources of hourly income, online marketplaces enable small businesses to sell anywhere in the world, and property sharing can turn any owner into a host.

With an estimated 30%\+ market share of worldwide property sharing, we expect Airbnb to continue leading the industry forward. We own shares for our fund through Forge Global.
