summary: Airbnb has powered nearly $100 billion in cumulative bookings, changing how
  the world travels. Armed with a business model that generates cash in one of the

## It’s reshaping a huge industry:

The global travel and tourism industry generates $8.8 trillion in activity every year. Airbnb, founded in 2008, is on track to complete over $30 billion\* in bookings in 2020 alone.

Traditional hospitality providers - like Marriott - had to spend billions building hotels to accommodate travelers. Airbnb, by contrast, invests in modern technology that enables any property owner to become a host.

## It's business model generates a lot of cash:

Uber, WeWork, and Slack were all introduced to public investors with businesses that took billions to build and were still losing cash. Their valuations all flopped - the public market cannot apply a sustainable valuation to unsustainable business practices.

Airbnb, by contrast, still holds more than $3 billion of the $3.4 billion it raised from investors. Part of this is explained by their business model: 80% of properties are paid for at least 10 days in advance, but hosts are not paid until 1-2 days after guests arrive. 1-2 weeks of cashflow to the company across millions of Airbnbs creates billions in cash to manage the business.

## It’s online:

There are many ways to track the growth of businesses built in the digital world.
AirDNA metrics
SensorTower downloads: Airbnb’s share of the total rose from 42% in 2015 to 69% in 2019.

We’ve been acquiring shares in Airbnb via Forge Global, and expect to remain investors years beyond their IPO later this year.
