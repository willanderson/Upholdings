Constructing a portfolio takes both bottoms up and tops down planning.

The S&P 500 is comprised of the largest 500 companies in the USA. 

Three ways to beat the S&P:

- Include non-USA companies in your search; China is the 2nd best place to look for market leading businesses given the size of their country and sophistication of their technology

- Identify private companies with a high likelihood of becoming standalone public companies. Companies that are big, but have not raised a lot of money are the best constituents.

- Study emerging companies that on their current trajectory are likely to be future members of the S&P 500.

The rules of the S&P prevent it from pulling from companies in any of those three areas, which means those are three areas that are an advantage to investors. 

There are some companies in the S&P that will outperform the average of the S&P as well.
