Financial Advisors are often asked about the latest IPOs - with Airbnb coming, here's what we know already, and what we're looking out for when they finally file that S-1.

At Upholdings, we use very strict criteria to find the best investments. This narrows the field of companies that we invest in. We keep a big field in two ways: first, we consider private companies for investment, and we also consider companies outside of the USA.

Here's everything you need to know about Airbnb, and what to expect in its IPO.

It competes in the biggest market in the world:

Global travel and tourism is an $8.8 trillion industry. Just the hotel industry is $570 billion. Airbnb is on track to complete over $40 billion in travel bookings in 2020, growing more than 20% again over the year prior and lots of room left to go.

It has a 5-year\+ technology advantage over its biggest competitor:

Booking.com vs. Airbnb: The DNA of these companies is very strong, but very different. Booking.com's technology primarily replaced the travel agent by empowering any user of the internet to find and book all aspects of their trip. Airbnb's technology unlocked an entirely new category of hospitality enabling anyone to become a host. Never-before-seen properties are now possible with Airbnb.

It's business model generates cashflow that the company uses to power its own growth: 

80% of properties are booked 10 days or more in advance. When you book an Airbnb, you pay 50% at the time of the booking. This means the company gets cash before it has to pay it out to the hosts. Hosts are not paid until 1-2 days after guest arrives. Airbnb still has all of the venture capital money that it raised. 

And it's just getting started:

Most investors write articles after they've made their money. We think it's important for our investors to transparently ride along with us. Airbnb's shareholders are holding on -- most are not looking to exit in the IPO.

Ways to Invest

Before Airbnb, Forge Global worked successfully with Spotify and Slack employees and investors to exchange shares before they were public companies. High net worth clients can work with Forge directly to acquire their own shares. For most clients, our fund provides another way.
